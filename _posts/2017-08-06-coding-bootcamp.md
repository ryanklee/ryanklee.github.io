## The Software Guild's Coding Bootcamp

As the initial step in a major career shift, I've enrolled in [The Software Guild's](https://www.thesoftwareguild.com/) C#/.NET online track. It's slated to start, well, tomorrow.
 
Since enrolling about a month ago, I've been in a crazed, tilted prep mode. Here's what I've been up to...

### Time is flat spreadsheet

The Software Guild's course is an estimated 800 hours and completed in 10 months on average. Now, I'm highly motivated to leave my current line of work and to start gaining industry experience as soon as possible, which brings me to my first quantifiable goal:

**Goal A1: _Complete the online bootcamp course in 8 months._**

At the projected 800 hours, that's 25 hours a week, or 3.57 hours a day.

I've created a spreadsheet that carves up every day into blocks of 15 min increments. For up close and personal time-management gore, here's a [google sheets version](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vpfhr5V_sfFkV3rfiECmxz691qH3DP51We092A2nQP4/edit?usp=sharing). For the less inclined, below is a cropped image, shown here primarily to call attention to the key.

The activities indicated in the key are (theoretically) a non-negotiable presence in my life, either because they are infrastructural (like driving or sleeping) or because they are supremely valuable to reaching my goals (like deep work).  

Their positioning in the block schedule is effective as heavy, fixed, obdurate obligations, movable only under heavy structural pressure, catastrophe, or as a consequence of deliberate, planned reorganization. 

Hence, **BLOCKS**. If someone kicks them, they should expect to break a toe.

On the other hand, this is a work in progress. I fully expect to make modifications every week in response to challenges met, lessons learned, etc.

### Slaying my entropy monsters

Note the in image above the sums of hours devoted to each activity. These let me quantify how much of my time is being devoted to what activity.

For the moment, the big variable I'm attempting to get under control is the **deep work** time block, which is time reserved exclusively for attending to deliberative practice and study devoted my active goal in life.

Deep work is a concept popularized by Cal Newport in [his book of the same name](http://a.co/gHXB88D). The idea is pretty straightforward: when you want to think hard about something, get rid of all distractions. No phone, no internet, no side-chatter. Just you, the task, and time to do it. ( There's quite a bit more to it, and I enthusiastically recommend the book, but for a great intro, check out [Ezra Klein's interview with Newport](https://www.vox.com/2017/4/21/15382282/cal-newport-taking-life-back-technology).)

At the moment, the goal these hours will be devoted to are tasks aimed at  completing The Software Guild's online course material. 

My block schedule shows me that the time apportionee to **deep work** is slightly exceeding my goal of 25 hours a week. This rubric would put me on track to meet my goal of completing the course in 8 months (by March 2018).

Now, this assumes my hours are equal to the average hour used in The Software Guild's own claim that the course takes most people 10 months to complete. This could turn out not to be the case. 

My hours could be less productive on average. They could turn out to be more productive. I'll have to find ways to measure comparative performance along the way.

In particular, I'll want to know whether 25.5 hours of deep work toward this goal will be enough to get me there. *Or if it's too much.*

In any case, there is a purported upper cognitive limit that has to be dealt with. Anything [beyond 4 hours of intense concentration](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2013/02/04/four-hours-of-concentration/) produces diminishing returns. Less is more.

On Saturdays and Sundays, I'm exceeding the 4 hour mark by 1.5 hrs each day. I'd shift those hours to other days, but again, the tight tolerances mean there's no way at the moment. 

In short, I could use a few hours *less*, not more.

### Goals for the coming week

* Track in a spreadsheet how many hours of the deep focus I actually achieve. (25.5 is a lofty goal for the first week, so expect to come in much lower.)
* Track how much time each discrete piece of course material takes to complete. Assign these pieces types. Use these types to make predictions in the future about expected difficulty and time-to-complete.
* Record structural weaknesses in schedule. What's not working. Theorize why.
* Figure out how to add 1 tech meetup into the schedule every week.
